# Visual_Inspection_of_Motorcycle_Connecting_Rods
Visual Inspection of Motorcycle Connecting Rods with the use of OpenCV 
Development of a software system aimed at visual inspection of motorcycle connecting 
rods. The system should be able to analyse the dimensions of two different types of connecting rods
to allow a vision-guided robot to pick and sort rods based on their type and dimensions. The two 
rod types are characterized by a different number of holes: Type A rods have one hole whilst Type 
B rods have two holes.
